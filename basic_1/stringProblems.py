#1.String Reversal:
#Write a function that takes a string and returns the string in reverse order. For example, if s = "hello", the function should return "olleh".

#2Palindrome Check:
#Write a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces and punctuation). For example, "racecar" is a palindrome.

#3Count Vowels:
#Write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string. For example, if s = "hello world", the output should be 3 (e, o, o).

#4Character Frequency:
#Write a function that takes a string and returns a dictionary that contains the frequency of each character in the string. For example, for s = "hello", the output should be {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}.

#5String Compression:
#Write a function that compresses a string by converting repeated characters into a single character followed by its count. For example, for s = "aaabbbccc", the function should return "a3b3c3". If the compressed string is not shorter than the original, return the original string.
